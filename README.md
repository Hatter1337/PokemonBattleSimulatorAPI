# PokemonBattleSimulatorAPI
PokemonBattle Simulator API is a lightweight and efficient REST API designed to simulate Pokémon battles, 
deployed on AWS using Serverless Application Model (SAM) and enhanced with AWS Lambda Powertools. 
Leveraging data from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), it calculates battle outcomes based on Pokémon stats like HP, Attack, Defense, and Speed. This project demonstrates serverless architecture, offering scalable and cost-effective solutions for real-time Pokémon battle simulations.
